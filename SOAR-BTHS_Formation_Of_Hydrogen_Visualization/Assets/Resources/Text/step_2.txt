Now, pour Hydrochloric Acid into the thistle tube fixed to the erlenmeyer flask. Take care not to spill any, as it is very dangerous. The reaction that occurs will force Hydrogen gas out of the tube in the trough, which will bubble up throuh the water. Let it bubble for a few seconds before sliding a bottle over to capture the released gas.
